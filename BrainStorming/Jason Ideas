-World map will be procedurally generated with islands and towns
-Fire Emblem battle system without magic, so the standard Axe > Pike > Sword > Axe
-Every character can weild ranged weapons but can only equip one and has varying degree of skill with each one depending on class
-Branching Class system
-Simple Trading and Economic logic 
-Control Fleet of ships
-Ship battles(have no idea how this should work)
-Ship boarding battles will be super simple as the map is just to ship top decks
-Can seige towns(multi stage battles?) standard fire emblem battle affair
-Possible town building 

Not married to any idea so feel free to augment with your own take.
